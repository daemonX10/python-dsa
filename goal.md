hereâ€™s a powerful prompt you can use to generate a complete, customized Python DSA reference (with syntax, theory, and usage for all major data structures) â€” tailored for someone switching from C++ (STL-style) to Python.
ðŸ§  Prompt to Generate a Full DSA Reference in Python (with theory + syntax + C++ comparison)
Prompt: "I want a complete Python Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) syntax and theory reference, designed for someone coming from C++ STL.
Cover the following in depth:
1. Arrays/List
2. Strings
3. Tuples
4. Dictionaries (dict, defaultdict, OrderedDict, Counter)
5. Sets (set, frozenset)
6. Stack and Queue (list, deque, LifoQueue, Queue)
7. Linked List (custom class)
8. Trees (basic binary trees + tree traversal)
9. Graphs (adjacency list using defaultdict + traversal)
10. Priority Queue (heapq)
11. Tries (custom class)
12. Union-Find (DSU)
13. Sliding Window
14. Greedy patterns
15. Dynamic Programming (memoization, tabulation)
16. Backtracking templates
For each topic, include:
* Syntax with brief explanation
* Common operations
* Iteration examples
* Real-world problems or use-cases
* Equivalent STL concept in C++
* Tips for competitive programming or interviews.
I want the output in structured sections â€” ready to be used as a reference or cheat sheet web page , don't miss anything , give everthing , iteration on hashmap ,adding ,deleting , string operation , array list operation , all collection one
